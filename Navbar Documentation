This is a navbar component in React. It consists of HTML and CSS code.

The CSS code defines the style for the navbar. It sets the position to fixed, which makes it stick to the top of the page even when the user scrolls. It also sets the background color and font color.

The HTML code defines the structure of the navbar. It consists of two parts: the left part and the right part. The left part contains the brand name of the website, which is a Link component from React Router. The right part contains a list of menu items, each of which is also a Link component.

There is also a dropdown menu for inventory management, which is implemented using a button with an onClick event that toggles the visibility of a div containing the submenu items.

The JS code defines the behavior of the dropdown menu. It uses the useState hook to create a state variable that tracks whether the dropdown menu is visible or not. When the button is clicked, it toggles the state variable, which causes the dropdown menu to be shown or hidden.

This is a React functional component called Navbar that displays a navigation bar.

First, it imports React, useState hook, and Link component from the react and react-router-dom libraries respectively, as well as a CSS file called Navbar.css.

The function returns a nav element with a class name of navbar, which contains two child elements: a div element with a class name of navbar__left, and another div element with a class name of navbar__right.

The navbar__left div contains a Link component with a class name of navbar__brand, which itself contains a span element with a class name of navbar__brand-text.

The navbar__right div contains a ul element with a class name of navbar__menu. Within the ul element, there are three li elements with a class name of navbar__item. The first li contains a Link component with a class name of navbar__link, while the second li contains a button with a class name of navbar__link and navbar__link--dropdown. The third li contains another Link component with a class name of navbar__link.

When the button in the second li is clicked, it toggles a dropdown menu, which is implemented using the useState hook. The dropdown menu consists of a div element with a class name of navbar__dropdown, which contains a ul element with a class name of navbar__submenu. Within the ul element, there are three li elements with a class name of navbar__submenu-item, each of which contains a Link component with a class name of navbar__submenu-link.

Finally, the component is exported as the default export of the module.
