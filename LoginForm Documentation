This is a simple React component called LoginForm that renders a form for a user to input their username and password.

Here's what's going on in the code:

Import React and useState hooks, along with the CSS file.
Create the LoginForm functional component.
Set up state variables for username, password, and showError using the useState hook. showError will be used to display an error message if the password is incorrect.
Create functions to handle changes in the username and password input fields (handleUsernameChange and handlePasswordChange). These functions update the state variables as the user types.
Create a function called handleSubmit that is called when the form is submitted. This function checks if the password is equal to 'NTSDSS'. If so, it redirects the user to the '/homepage' route. If not, it shows an error message by setting showError to true.
Render the form with input fields for username and password, and a submit button. The showError state is used to conditionally display an error message if the password is incorrect.
Export the LoginForm component.
