# Company-Decision-Support-System
This is a comprehensive Full-Stack web development project that represents a powerful combination of technologies. It enabled me to handle server-side development, data storage, and manipulation (MySQL, Express.js, Node.js) while utilizing React.js to build interactive and responsive user interfaces on the client-side.


The system aims to provide a comprehensive solution for efficient inventory management and decision-making processes powered by a dashboard by leveraging advanced technologies such as JavaScript libraries (React.js,Charts.js) and an open source database (MYSQL). The present system employs a holistic methodology that prioritises user-centric objectives and the development of a robust inventory management dashboard, as opposed to conventional pre-packaged solutions such as SAP.The objective of this project is to deliver a cost-efficient solution that grants NTS(National Trading Syndicate Ltd. which is a real biomedical retailer company) enhanced control and flexibility through the utilisation of open-source technologies.

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a decision support system integrated with an inventory management system. This system is facilitating strategic decision-making within the company by effectively recording and presenting information related to product purchases, quantities, and sales. The cost associated with purchasing and selling products, as well as the monitoring of inventory quantities, will be calculated and tracked throughout the entire product lifecycle, from procurement to sales. The proposed approach aims to identify patterns and promptly react in order to maintain adequate stock levels. In addition, it  contributes to the maintenance of optimal stock levels, thereby minimising the occurrence of stock-outs and inaccuracies in record-keeping. This project has also integrated a Decision Support System with an analytical system in order to facilitate decision-making processes. In addition to monitoring sales and inventory levels, the system will generate fundamental accounting reports, including income statements and balance sheets, as the intended ultimate result.

It's suggested that you view the video to understand the performance of the system. Please note that as this is an active project for a company, we're not able to provide all the information due to legal issues. This is just to demonstrate the work I have done.
