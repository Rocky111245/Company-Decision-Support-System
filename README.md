# Decision Support System

## Overview

The **Decision Support System** is a comprehensive full-stack web development project designed to streamline and enhance inventory management and decision-making processes. This system uses real client data from **National Trading Syndicate Ltd.**, a biomedical retailer company, to prototype a SAP-like ERP solution. The primary goal of this project was to experiment with and integrate new technologies to deliver a cost-efficient solution that offers enhanced control and flexibility compared to conventional ERP systems like SAP.

This project showcases server-side development, data storage, and manipulation using **MySQL**, **Express.js**, and **Node.js**, while utilizing **React.js** to build interactive and responsive user interfaces on the client-side. The system provides a real-time dashboard powered by **Chart.js**, reflecting the current stock conditions and supporting strategic decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed with React.js and Chart.js, the dashboard offers real-time visual insights into inventory status and business metrics.
- **Advanced Inventory Management**: Users can add, remove, and manage inventory items, with changes reflected in real-time, integrated with a MySQL database.
- **Decision Support System (DSS)**: Integrated DSS assists in strategic decision-making by analyzing inventory data, sales trends, and other key metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: For building a responsive, interactive user interface.
  - **Chart.js**: For dynamic and real-time data visualization.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js**: For handling server-side operations and API requests.
  - **Prisma ORM**: Used to simplify database interactions with MySQL.

- **Database**: 
  - **MySQL**: Relational database management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Project Architecture

This section provides a detailed overview of the project's architecture, showcasing the interaction between the frontend, backend, and database layers. It highlights how the system manages data flow and ensures real-time updates across all components.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Real Data Integration**: The project was developed using real client data, ensuring that the system was validated under realistic conditions.
- **React.js Integration**: Utilized advanced React.js techniques, including state management to create a seamless user experience.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: The dashboard reflects the most current data available through real-time updates.
- **Security Considerations**: Basic security measures were implemented to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Database Management**: MySQL, combined with Prisma ORM, was effectively used to manage and optimize complex database operations.
- **Technology Integration**: The project aimed to integrate and experiment with new technologies, ensuring a modern and scalable solution.

## Conclusion

The **NTS Decision Support System** is a robust and flexible solution that leverages modern web technologies to address the specific needs of inventory management and decision-making in a real-world business context. The implementation successfully combined various technologies to create a meaningful inventory management system coupled with a decision support system, providing a comprehensive overview of stock conditions and supporting strategic decision-making processes.
Due to the reliance on a MySQL database and real client data, setting up this project locally may require substantial effort. The repository is available for review to showcase the technical depth and strategic implementation that went into developing this system.
