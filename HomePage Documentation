In this code, we have a functional component named Homepage that represents the main page of the application. It imports a CSS file and a Navbar component that will be displayed at the top of the page.

The Homepage component defines a state hook called activeTab which is used to keep track of the currently active tab on the Navbar component. It also defines a function handleTabClick that will be passed down to the Navbar component as a prop to handle the change of the active tab when a user clicks on a tab.

In the return statement, we have a container div with a class name homepage-container. Inside this container, we render the Navbar component, passing down the activeTab and handleTabClick props.

Then we have another div with a class name homepage-content that will contain the content of the homepage. Inside this div, we conditionally render different content based on the value of the activeTab state.

For example, if the activeTab is 'Dashboard', we render a heading that says "Dashboard Content". If it is 'StockIn', we render a heading that says "Stock In Content", and so on.
